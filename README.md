# Cinema-Website
My First Semester Project - Brief was to create a website for a local horror cinema chain called Eye Candy Cinemas. 

The website is done using HTML/CSS, with a little bit of javascript for the header bar. 
The screening times/ booking systems/ forms are not set up to work. 
Images & logo (except movie posters) all created by me using photos from Unsplash.
